//UNSTARTED LANGUAGES

//MandarinChinese
//CantoneseChinese
//BritishEnglish --  ineligible for rule-based.
//AmericanEnglish --  ineligible for rule-based.

/*
Arabic --  ineligible for pure rule-based, as orthography usually does not include vowels.
3 possibilities:
1. give up on transcribing the vowels; they vary a lot anyway, by semitic conjugation
2. Transcribe Google Translate's arbitrary arabic pronunciation guide for english speakers,
which likely has dictionary-lookup hints for common words.
3. Contact Dr Claire Brierley of Leeds University and ask for copy of her research group's
 IPA transcription software for Modern Standard Arabic.

French
------

  DONE scraper. West European Colonial Language;
 probably eligible for rule-based to a varying degree, depending on cultural factors
1. cultural preference between linguistic conservation and progress:
 strong conservative tradition. L'academie Française does sometimes update spellings  however
2. influence of colonial speakers on the mother language:
 little influence, barring loanwords
3. degree of education of speakers:
 high education, meaning they remember lots of irregularities.
prediction: probably irregular

German: West European Colonial Language
-------
 probably eligible for rule-based to a varying degree, depending on cultural factors:
1. cultural preference between linguistic conservation and progress:
 I'd say fairly progressive? replacement of ß with ss is taking hold, and english loanwords are prevalent
2. influence of colonial speakers on the mother language:
 DACH countries had little influence colonially, so no feedback from the colonies there
3. degree of education of speakers:
 high education, meaning they remember lots of irregularities.
prediction: fairly regular, but known to have lots of variants
